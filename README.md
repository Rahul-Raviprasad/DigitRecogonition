# DigitRecogonition

The goal in this program is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.

Classification method used K-nearest neighbors

## TODO:
* use simple neural networks
* try classification with SVM

The data for this competition was taken from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset is a classic within the Machine Learning community that has been extensively studied.  More detail about the dataset, including Machine Learning algorithms that have been tried on it and their levels of success, can be found here.
